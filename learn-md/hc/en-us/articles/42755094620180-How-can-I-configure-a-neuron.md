# How can I configure a neuron?

After you [created a neuron](/hc/en-us/articles/42754119358484), you can set it up and modify it. These are some of the attributes you can modify that influence the neuron's [voting power](/hc/en-us/articles/34084120668692#h_01JJ26P5EEPSRQSN0Y3Q2Y975K) and state:

- Start the dissolve delay timer by clicking **Start Unlock**.
- Increase the dissolve delay period by clicking **Increase Dissolve Delay**.
- Stop the dissolve delay after starting the unlock countdown by clicking **Lockup**.

## How to start and stop dissolving the neuron

Creating a new neuron does not automatically start the dissolve delay timer. If you want to start the timer countdown, you have to do so by explicitly clicking **Start Dissolving** on the neuron detail page.

For example, if you set a dissolve delay of 200 days and want to immediately begin the countdown, you should click 'Start Dissolving' as part of the process of creating the neuron. If you change your mind and want to stop a current countdown in progress, you can click **Stop Dissolving**.

After you click Stop Dissolving, you can click Start Dissolving again to resume the countdown without changing the existing dissolve delay period.

If you start the dissolving of a neuron, the neuron's [age](/hc/en-us/articles/34084120668692#h_01JJ26P5EEPSRQSN0Y3Q2Y975K) is set back to zero. Therefore, starting dissolving and stopping it again does not result in exactly the same neuron.

## How to increase a neuron's dissolve delay

No matter if a neuron is dissolving or non-dissolving, you can increase the lockup period by clicking Increase Dissolve Delay then select a longer dissolve delay.
