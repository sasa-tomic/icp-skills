# What is a Principal?

The concept of a principal appears at the level of canister smart contracts. In a nutshell, a principal identifies any entity that can call a canister. As both canisters and external users can call canisters, principals include both canister ids and self-authenticating identifiers derived from public keys of users. There are several classes of principals:

1. The [Internet Computer Management Canister](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec#ic-management-canister), which is a specific system API that can be called like a canister, uses the fixed principal *aaaaa-aa*.
2. Canister ids: each canister on ICP is identified by its canister id.
3. Self-authenticating ids: derived from public keys to identify users.
4. Derived ids: a class which has been reserved but never implemented.
5. The anonymous id, *2vxsx-fae:*  used as the identity of the caller for messages that are not signed.

More details can be found in the [relevant section of the interface specification](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec#principal).
