# Chain-Key Cryptography

*Chain-key cryptography* enables subnets of the Internet Computer to jointly hold cryptographic keys, in a way that no small subset of potentially misbehaving nodes on the subnet can perform useful operations with the key, but the majority of honest nodes together can. Chain-key cryptography provides several major benefits to ICP:

1. Secure and efficient subnet-to-subnet communication enables ICP to scale horizontally, increasing the compute and memory capacity as more nodes are joining the Internet Computer.
2. [Certified responses](/hc/en-us/articles/34214090576404) enable clients to validate the information they receive from ICP nodes efficiently and without the need of keeping any blockchain state.
3. Smart contracts have access to a source of unpredictable and unbiased randomness.
4. [Chain-key signatures](/hc/en-us/articles/34209497587732) enable canister smart contracts on ICP to hold assets and invoke smart contracts on other blockchain networks.
5. [vetKeys](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/vetkeys-overview) enable dapps to encrypt data based on encryption keys controlled by canister smart contracts.

## Digital Signatures

A *digital signature scheme* is a very traditional type of public-key cryptosystem, in which a secret key (held only by the signer) is used to generate a digital signature on a message, and a public key (available to everyone) may be used to efficiently verify a digital signature on a message. The basic security property achieved by such a scheme is that a valid signature on a message cannot be created without explicitly invoking the signing algorithm with the corresponding secret key.

A *threshold signature scheme* is a digital signature scheme where the secret signing key is never stored in one location (which would become a single point of failure). Rather, the secret key is effectively split up into *secret shares*, and each secret share is stored on a different machine. To sign a message, these machines must agree to sign the message and coordinate with one another to generate a digital signature in a distributed fashion (importantly, without ever reconstructing the secret signing key in one location).

## Sharing Cryptographic Keys among the Nodes of a Subnet

While threshold signature schemes have been around for a long time, the Internet Computer is the first blockchain-based system to fully integrate this technology in the core of its design.  Each subnet is associated with the public key of such a threshold signature scheme.

More technically, Chain-Key Cryptography is the combination of two cryptographic protocols: The first is a *distributed key generation* protocol in which nodes of a subnet can together generate shares of a cryptographic key. The protocol ensures that the actual cryptographic key never actually exists at any one place, it exists only *virtually*, determined by the shares held by all nodes together. A variation of the same protocol is used to re-share the cryptographic key when, e.g. the membership of a subnet changes and new nodes participate in the protocol. The second protocol is the *threshold signature* protocol, which the nodes evaluate together when a message has to be signed.
