# Tokenomics & Governance

The Internet Computer's tokenomics model is centered around two native tokens: [cycles](/hc/en-us/articles/34573913497108) and ICP. The ICP token plays a critical role in the decentralized network governance and operation. Decentralized applications (dapps) running on the Internet Computer can also use a token-based governance, based on their own, application-specific token.

In this section, you will find articles describing:

- [Tokenomics](/hc/en-us/articles/34090810571284): the economic model of the Internet Computer, encompassing token creation, distribution, and usage that influence its value and overall ecosystem,
- [Network Nervous Systems](/hc/en-us/articles/33692645961236): onchain decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that governs the Internet Computer Protocol,
- [Service Nervous System:](/hc/en-us/articles/34084394684564) framework for creating and maintaining DAOs to govern dapps on the Internet computer.
