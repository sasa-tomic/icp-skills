# How can I top up a neuron?

After you [create a neuron](/hc/en-us/articles/42754119358484), you can increase the number of ICP utility tokens you have staked in that neuron to increase your voting power and rewards. For example, if you initially stake a small number of ICP utility tokens, then decide to purchase additional tokens, you have the option to create a new neuron or "top-up" your existing neuron.

To increase the stake in an existing neuron:

#### Step 1: On the NNS dapp, go to the Neuron Staking tab and then the table Staked ICP. Then click on a neuron.

#### Step 2: Click Increase Stake.
