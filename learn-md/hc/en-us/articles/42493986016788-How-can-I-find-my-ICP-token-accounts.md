# How can I find my (ICP) token accounts?

Logging into the NNS dapp using an Internet Identity creates a main account for you in the ICP ledger as well as in the other ledgers you might want to interact with.

We show you how you can find your token account on the example of the ICP token.

#### Step 1: Go on the 'Tokens' tab in the left menu.

#### Step 2: Select the token you would like to see in the right table. In this case, select 'Internet Computer'.

#### Step 3: You now see your main ICP account.

When you log in for the first time, most likely your main account displays 0.00 for your ICP utility token balance.

You can now [receive tokens](/hc/en-us/articles/42494789123092), [send tokens](/hc/en-us/articles/42499104466324), or [add another account](/hc/en-us/articles/42494280383252).
