# ICP subsystems

ICP has multiple levels of subsystems and decentralization. Using the metaphor of a stack, they are (from top to bottom):

**1. “Common Good” apps on the IC**

- These are apps the community uses, often as public goods
- These are controlled by NNS DAO or individual DAOs (e.g. Internet Identity, NNS frontend dapp, SNS)
- Examples of such apps:
  - NNS dapp
    - Code repository: <https://github.com/dfinity/nns-dapp>
    - Canister: [qoctq-giaaa-aaaaa-aaaea-cai](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/qoctq-giaaa-aaaaa-aaaea-cai)
  - Internet identity
    - Code repository: <https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity>
    - Canister: [rdmx6-jaaaa-aaaaa-aaadq-cai](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/rdmx6-jaaaa-aaaaa-aaadq-cai)

**2. Protocol Governance**

- ICP is controlled by the NNS DAO
- All changes to the protocol or the topology are directly driven by decisions of the DAO
- See [Dashboard: Governance](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/governance)

**3. Infrastructure Layer**

- Nodes are the physical layer of ICP (how & which nodes participate in the network)
- See [Dashboard: Network](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/network)
