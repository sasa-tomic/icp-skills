# Evolution & Scaling

The Internet Computer has the capability to adapt to changing application needs. In case of growing demand for resources, the creation of new subnets provides horizontal scalability. The protocol is also upgraded regularly, allowing for improvements in efficiency as well as extension of functionality.

- [Subnet creation:](/hc/en-us/articles/34209955782420) The capacity of the network scales in response to user demand. To achieve this, the Internet Computer's architecture allows for the seamless addition of nodes and subnets, effectively expanding the network's resources and ensuring it can handle increasing usage.
- [Chain evolution:](/hc/en-us/articles/34210120121748) To meet the changing demands of its users, the Internet Computer has been design to evolve over time. Upgradeability must not come at the expense of the system's fundamental principles: decentralization and security. The Internet Computer must maintain its robust guarantees in these areas even as it evolves.
