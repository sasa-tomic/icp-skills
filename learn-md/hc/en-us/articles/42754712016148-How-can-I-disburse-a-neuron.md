# How can I disburse a neuron?

When the dissolve delay timer for a neuron reaches zero, it is **dissolved** and you can disburse the neuron’s stake and transfer its locked ICP utility token balance to the ledger account you specify.

To disburse a neuron and return its ICP utility tokens:

#### Step 1: On the [NNS dapp](https://nns.ic0.app/), go to the Neuron Staking tab and then the table Staked ICP. Then click on an dissolved neuron that has reach the ended of its dissolve delay period (indicated by 'Unlocked').

#### Step 2: Click **Disburse**.
