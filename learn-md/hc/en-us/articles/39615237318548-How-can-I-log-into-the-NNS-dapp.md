# How can I log into the NNS dapp?

## Overview

There are different ways to interact with the NNS to stake ICP tokens and participate in governance.

This guide demonstrates how to interface with the NNS through the [NNS dapp](https://nns.ic0.app). You can interact with the NNS through other tools, such as [quill](https://github.com/dfinity/quill) and [ic-js](https://github.com/dfinity/ic-js/tree/main/packages/nns).

This section starts with a tutorial on how to connect and log in to the NNS dapp.

If you haven’t previously registered, you can click **Register with Internet Identity** to register.

It is recommended that you add multiple devices and authentication methods to your Internet Identity. For example, register multiple physical devices like your computer and phone with a security key and using the authentication options that those devices—and browsers running on them—support.

For more information about creating an Internet Identity, see [how to use Internet Identity](https://identitysupport.dfinity.org/hc/en-us/articles/15430677359124-How-do-I-create-an-Internet-Identity-on-my-mobile-device).

After you have registered, you can click **Login** to authenticate using your anchor and the authentication method—for example, a security key or fingerprint—you have registered.

#### Step 3:  Click **Proceed** to access to the Network Nervous System (NNS) dapp.
