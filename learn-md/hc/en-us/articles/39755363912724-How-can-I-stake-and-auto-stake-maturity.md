# How can I stake and auto-stake maturity?

## Overview

This tutorial is focused on NNS neurons. In SNS DAOs with voting rewards the concepts are very similar and the same tutorial might be helpful.

As you stake a neuron in the NNS and participate in governance, by voting directly or by delegating your voting power to others, your neuron receives voting rewards in the form of [maturity that can be *disbursed* or *staked*.](/hc/en-us/articles/34084120668692-Neurons#01JJ7BJX36NH538SCDQFHSJSVD)

## Stake maturity

When you have available maturity, you can stake it.  Staked maturity is viewed as part of the neuron's stake and contributes to the neuron's voting power. Find more information in [Voting rewards & maturity](/hc/en-us/articles/34084120668692-Neurons#01JJ7BJX36NH538SCDQFHSJSVD).

#### Step 1: On the [staking page](https://nns.ic0.app/neurons/?u=qoctq-giaaa-aaaaa-aaaea-cai), navigate to the neuron whose maturity you want to disburse.

Click **Stake** in the **Maturity** section.

## Automatically stake maturity

In order to not have to regularly perform the action of staking maturity, you can also choose to auto-stake a neuron's maturity. This means that all new maturity will automatically be added to the staked maturity.

#### Step 1: On the [staking page](https://nns.ic0.app/neurons/?u=qoctq-giaaa-aaaaa-aaaea-cai), navigate to the Advanced Details & Settings.

Choose **Automatically stake new maturity**.

#### Step 2: In the form that opens, confirm the setting.

#### Step 3: As a result of the operation, you see that now **Automatically stake new maturity** is ticked, indicating that it is chosen for this neuron.
