# How can I send ICP tokens?

Once you have ICP tokens in your NNS dapp account, you can send them to other accounts by following these steps.

#### Step 1: Go on the Internet Computer Account page.

If you already [added sub-accounts](/hc/en-us/articles/42494280383252), you now see the list of them.

Transactions are charged a ledger fee, which is independent from the NNS dapp and applies to any transaction. For ICP tokens, this fee is 0.0001 ICP.

The maximum amount you can send is your token balance minus the ledger fee. The minimum amount you can send is 0.00000001 ICP.

#### Step 4: Select Continue, review the transaction, and if you are happy with it press Send Now to send the transaction.

The destination address can be any address in the ledger canister which might correspond to:

- A wallet that is owned by a developer principal.
- An account you have added using the NNS dapp.
- An address for a wallet you have on an exchange.

If you transfer the ICP utility tokens to an account in the NNS dapp, you might need to refresh the browser to see the transaction reflected.
